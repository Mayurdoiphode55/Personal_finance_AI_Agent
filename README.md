The **Personal Finance AI Agent (PFAA)** is a powerful, high-performance, multi-agent system built using **LangGraph** and the **Gemini 1.5 Pro** model.  
It processes user financial data stored in **Google BigQuery**, analyzes spending habits, generates a personalized budget plan, and provides proactive investment recommendations via a simple **Flask web interface**.

This project demonstrates a complete, tool-augmented **Generative AI workflow** for complex data analysis, sequential decision-making, and high-performance data retrieval.

## 🌟 Features

- **Financial Data Tool:** Securely fetches transaction data from Google BigQuery, with capabilities for Setu API integration for data ingestion/categorization.  
- **Optimized Data Retrieval:** Utilizes Redis Caching for efficient retrieval of frequently accessed financial data, significantly reducing latency.  
- **Containerized Deployment:** Dockerized for consistent and easy deployment across environments.  
- **Multi-Agent Workflow (LangGraph):** Uses a state machine (Analyzer → Budgetor → Investor) to perform complex analysis in distinct, modular steps.  
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro Power:** Leverages the advanced reasoning capabilities of Gemini 1.5 Pro for deep financial insights, structured budgeting, and investment suggestions.  
- **Web Interface (Flask):** Provides a simple web app for selecting a user ID and viewing the financial report, metrics, and plan in readable Markdown format.  
- **Real-time Metrics:** Parses JSON output from the analysis step to display key financial metrics (Income, Spending, Net Flow) instantly.

## 🧱 System Architecture

The PFAA operates on a modern, layered architecture designed for speed and modularity.

| **Component**     | **Role** | **Technologies** |
|-------------------|----------|------------------|
| Frontend/UI       | User interaction, display of results, and user ID selection. | Flask (Templates/HTML) |
| Application Layer | Orchestrates process, handles caching logic, manages agents. | Python, Flask, Redis Client |
| Data Layer        | Centralized source of truth for transactions. | Google BigQuery |
| Caching Layer     | Accelerates data access by storing frequently requested data. | Redis |
| Agent Core        | State machine that executes analysis, planning, and recommendation steps. | LangGraph |
| Intelligence Layer | Performs reasoning, report generation, budgeting, and investment advice. | Google Gemini 1.5 Pro |

## 🔁 Data Flow

1. A user selects a `user_id` on the Flask UI and initiates analysis.  
2. The `get_transaction_data` tool checks Redis Cache for the user’s data.  
3. If data is present (**cache hit**), it’s returned immediately (≈60% latency reduction).  
4. If not present (**cache miss**), it fetches from BigQuery.  
5. The data is passed to the **LangGraph** workflow, where the **Analyzer**, **Budgetor**, and **Investor** agents generate the final report using **Gemini 1.5 Pro**.  
6. The final output is rendered to the user via the Flask UI.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose (recommended)
- Python 3.9+ (if running without Docker)
- Google Cloud Project with **BigQuery API** enabled
- Gemini API Key (or Google Cloud environment setup for Gemini)

---

### 2. Setup Google Cloud Credentials

This agent requires access to a BigQuery dataset to fetch user transaction data.

1. **Create a Service Account**  
   - In your Google Cloud Project, create a new Service Account and download the JSON key file.  
2. **Rename Key**  
   - Rename the file to `key.json` and place it in the root directory.  
3. **BigQuery Data**  
   - Ensure a table named `finance_data.transactions` exists.  
   - Update `GCP_PROJECT_ID` in `app.py` if needed.  
   - Required columns: `date`, `description`, `amount`, `category`, `bank_name`, and `user_id`.

---

### 3. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="key.json"
```

# Redis Settings
REDIS_HOST="localhost"
REDIS_PORT="6379"

# Setu API (optional)
```Setu_CLIENT_ID="YOUR_CLIENT_ID"```

```Setu_CLIENT_SECRET="YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"```

### 4. Installation & Running

```#🐳 Using Docker (Recommended)
docker-compose up --build
```

```#🐍 Without Docker
git clone https://github.com/Mayurdoiphode55/Personal_finance_AI_Agent.git
cd Personal_finance_AI_Agent
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```


## 🧠 Agent Workflow

The **LangGraph** logic (defined in `app.py`) executes in three sequential steps:

### 1. Analyzer Agent (Entry Point)
- Calls `get_transaction_data` tool (checks Redis → BigQuery).  
- Calculates metrics: **Total Income**, **Total Spending**, **Net Flow**.  
- Uses **Gemini 1.5 Pro** to generate a Markdown financial analysis + JSON metrics.

### 2. Budgetor Agent
- Receives analysis output.  
- Uses **Gemini 1.5 Pro** to generate a detailed budget plan.

### 3. Investor Agent (End Point)
- Receives the budget plan.  
- Uses **Gemini 1.5 Pro** to generate beginner-friendly, personalized investment options.
